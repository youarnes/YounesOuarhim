### 🏋️‍♂️ Gym Workout Tracker

- 🚀 **New Version Deployed!**
Check out the latest version of the app: [Lift Log V2](https://lift-log-v2.vercel.app/)
 🤩

- **Tech Stack:**
This app is built with Next.js. I used the Pages Router for its simplicity and clean backend setup, similar to Express.js syntax.
Tailwind CSS powers the design, ensuring a responsive and visually appealing layout on both desktop and mobile.

- **Access:**
If you'd like access to the app, just reach out to me for credentials.

- 🔓** Coming Soon:**
The code will be made public soon! Keep an eye out for the repo.

### HTTP Server (Work in Progress)
- HTTP servers are the backbone of web applications, so I decided to implement one from scratch as a hands-on learning project.  
This project explores low-level networking, request parsing, and response handling in C++.

- 🚧 The server is still under active development — stay tuned for the final version!
