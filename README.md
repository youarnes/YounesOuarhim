### HTTP Server (Work in Progress)
- HTTP servers are the backbone of web applications, so I decided to implement one from scratch as a hands-on learning project.  
This project explores low-level networking, request parsing, and response handling in C++.

🚧 The server is still under active development — stay tuned for the final version!
